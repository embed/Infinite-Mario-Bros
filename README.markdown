Infinite Mario Bros.
======================

This version is a fork of @cflewis version. There are two differences.

* It can build again on modern computers, tested on Ubuntu 21.04.
* You have infinite lives! Your life counter counts how many Marios you have used instead.

### Original README from cflewis

[Infinite Mario Bros](http://www.mojang.com/notch/mario/) source code has a bug in the timing, which prevents it working on Mac OS X, and maybe other platforms. This version uses the timing from the Mario AI competition, and is Mac-compatible.
